# String_Patterns_No_REGEX
Function that determines whether String is a valid phone number based on parameters (no REGEX) 

Takes 'message' that is assigned to another variable 'chunk' that loops through range of message and determines whether the range is considered to be a phone number based on our original function 'isPhoneNumber'

This of course could be simplified with REGEX and will be presented in a separate repo - as it stands right now, this could take in millions of lines of strings and output
all phone numbers in a matter of seconds.  REGEX will allow this to be written in a much more efficient manner.
